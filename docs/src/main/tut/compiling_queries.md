In the examples we've seen so far, XPath expressions were passed around as strings. This can be inefficient, since they
must be recompiled each time they're evaluated against a document.

When working with expressions that will need to be applied over and over, it's more efficient to compile them as
instances of [`Query`].

In order to show how that works, we'll need some sample XML data, which we'll get from this project's resources:

```tut:silent
val rawData: java.net.URL = getClass.getResource("/simple.xml")
```

This is what we're working with:

```tut
scala.io.Source.fromURL(rawData).mkString
```

We'll be trying to extract the `id` attribute of each `element` node as an `int`. Compiling the corresponding XPath
expression is done through [`compile`]:

```tut:silent
import kantan.xpath._
import kantan.xpath.ops._

val query = Query.compile[List[Int]]("//element/@id").get
```

Note that we called [`get`] on the return value: compiling an XPath expression might fail if the expression is invalid,
and [`Query.compile`] wraps its return value in a [`CompileResult`]. It's usually better to deal with errors rather than
let them turn into runtime exceptions, but if you don't mind them, you can also use the [`xpath`] method that enriches
strings:

```tut:silent
val query = "//element/@id".xpath[List[Int]]
```

You can now use the compiled query where you used to specify strings, such as in [`evalXPath`]:

```tut
rawData.evalXPath(query)
```

Note that since compiled queries carry the information of the type they return, you don't need to specify type
parameters to [`evalXPath`].

[`Query`] also acts as a `Node â‡’ A`, which means you can apply them directly on an XML document:

```tut
rawData.asNode.flatMap(query)
```
